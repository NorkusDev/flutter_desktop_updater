# desktop_updater

Flutter desktop updater plugin for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

2.x uses one small update index, one release descriptor, and one verified zip:

```text
app-archive.json -> release.json -> app.zip
```

No public folder listing is required. Clients fetch exact URLs and verify the
zip length and SHA-256 before installation.

## Quick Start

Add the package:

```yaml
dependencies:
  desktop_updater: ^2.3.0
```

Point your app at the hosted archive:

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: Uri.parse("https://updates.example.com/app-archive.json"),
);
```

Add `desktop_updater.yaml` at your app repository root, next to
`pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
updates:
  baseUrl: https://updates.example.com
```

Publish one platform:

```sh
dart run desktop_updater:release publish --platform macos
```

Before your first production release, run:

```sh
dart run desktop_updater:release doctor --platform macos
```

With only `updates.baseUrl`, publish creates an upload-ready package under
`dist/desktop_updater` and prints the manual upload and validate instructions.
With an upload provider configured, it uploads versioned files first, validates
them, uploads `app-archive.json` last, then validates hosted update selection.

## EL10

Think of your update host as a shelf on the internet:

1. The app reads `app-archive.json`.
2. The archive says which `release.json` is newest for this platform/channel.
3. `release.json` points to one zip and records its size and hash.
4. The app downloads the zip only after the metadata says it is a valid update.
5. The app verifies the zip before staging or installing it.

Publish does the reverse: create the zip, create `release.json`, update
`app-archive.json`, upload the versioned files first, then expose the new
archive last.

## Ready-Made UI

Use the stock inline card:

```dart
DesktopUpdateWidget(
  controller: controller,
  child: const YourHomePage(),
)
```

Other built-in surfaces:

- `DesktopUpdateDirectCard`
- `DesktopUpdateSliver`
- `UpdateDialogListener`

See [Ready-made UI widgets](docs/ui-widgets.md) for screenshots, placement
guidance, and when to choose each surface.

For custom UI, switch on `controller.state`.

## Release Notes

Use `releaseNotesLoader` when notes should depend on the selected descriptor,
platform, channel, locale, account, or environment:

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: Uri.parse("https://updates.example.com/app-archive.json"),
  releaseNotesLoader: (descriptor) {
    return myNotesApi.fetch(
      version: descriptor.version,
      platform: descriptor.platform,
      channel: descriptor.channel,
    );
  },
);
```

For a simple hosted file, pass `releaseNotesUrl` instead:

```dart
final controller = DesktopUpdaterController(
  appArchiveUrl: Uri.parse("https://updates.example.com/app-archive.json"),
  releaseNotesUrl: Uri.parse("https://updates.example.com/release-notes.json"),
);
```

The simple contributor-friendly JSON shape uses a `data` array:

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "type": "feat",  "message": "Add dark mode support" },
    { "type": "fix",   "message": "Fix crash on startup" },
    { "type": "other", "message": "General stability improvements" }
  ]
}
```

The richer package-owned shape supports sections, summaries, and item titles:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "format": "desktop_updater.release_notes.v1",
  "summary": "Quality improvements.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "type": "features",
      "title": "New features",
      "items": [
        { "body": "Add dark mode support" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The ready-made card shows a release notes icon when the active update can load
notes. Custom UI can call `controller.loadReleaseNotes()` and render
`controller.releaseNotesState`; the controller keeps caching, retry state, and
descriptor context aligned.

Localise the bottom sheet and override section labels via
`DesktopUpdateLocalization`:

```dart
localization: const DesktopUpdateLocalization(
  releaseNotesTitleText: "What's new",
  releaseNotesButtonTooltipText: "Release notes",
  releaseNotesTypeLabels: {
    "feat": "New features",
    "fix":  "Bug fixes",
    "other": "Other changes",
  },
  releaseNotesErrorText: "Could not load release notes.",
  releaseNotesRetryText: "Retry",
  releaseNotesEmptyText: "No release notes available for this version.",
),
```

## Error Tooltip

When an update fails the error icon shows a tooltip. Supply an
`onUpdateFailedTooltip` callback to return a custom string, or set
`updateFailedTooltipText` for one static fallback:

```dart
localization: DesktopUpdateLocalization(
  updateFailedTooltipText: "Update failed. Please try again.",
  onUpdateFailedTooltip: (error) {
    if (error is SocketException) return "No internet connection.";
    if (error is TimeoutException) return "Connection timed out.";
    return null; // falls back to updateFailedTooltipText
  },
),
```

## Diagnostics And Recovery

2.2.0 adds opt-in diagnostics and recovery for support flows. The default stays
quiet: no package-owned files, uploads, telemetry, or storage.

Use in-memory problem reports for normal support, add an app-owned diagnostics
sink for durable Dart lifecycle logs, and add `diagnosticsLogPath` plus an
app-owned `UpdateRecoveryStore` only when support needs post-exit native helper
evidence.

Details live in [Diagnostics and recovery](docs/diagnostics-and-recovery.md),
[Ready-made UI widgets](docs/ui-widgets.md#diagnostics-and-support), and
[Publishing desktop updates](docs/publishing.md#runtime-policies).

## Production Trust

desktop_updater handles update mechanics. Your app still owns platform trust:

- macOS production updates should be Developer ID signed, hardened-runtime
  enabled, notarized, stapled, and Gatekeeper accepted before packaging.
- Windows production updates should use Authenticode when publisher trust is
  required.
- Linux direct zip distribution should add descriptor signing or another
  publisher-authenticity policy when production trust matters.

  manual upload, providers, validation, CI, and platform-specific release work.

  signing choices, native package channels, and country or provider
  restrictions.

  the built-in card, sliver, dialog, and custom state-driven UI surfaces.

## Advanced Commands

Most apps should start with `release publish`. Use low-level commands only when
your pipeline needs to own each step:

```sh
dart run desktop_updater:package --help
dart run desktop_updater:app_archive --help
dart run desktop_updater:verify --help
```
